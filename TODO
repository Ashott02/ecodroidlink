* manual ip method

* manual ip + dns mode for direct computer to pi development via ssh +
   bt obex auto accept method too

* ifconfig how to speficy gateway and dns? test on home network

* make edl_nap do br by itself - do something like:
sudo ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 (or overrided eth0 param
sudo brctl delbr edl_br0
sudo brctl addbr edl_br0
sudo ifconfig edl_br0 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0
sudo dhclient edl_br0 (or if ip supplied and netmask supplied then
   sudo ifconfig a.a.a.a b.b.b.b) 

* tell user must install bridge-utils
* main param in edl_main optionally takes an interface name to
   overridate the default "eth0" and second param is ip - to use
   ifconfig instead of dhclient...

* test on raspbian and archlinux again...

* test ssh - development
